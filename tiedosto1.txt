I once lived in the woods. It was late, but the leaves were whispering fast; and when I awoke, I looked at the water. It was a spring, and it was quite hot, but I was thankful for it. There was a little little rock under the sink. When it began to boil I went to that spring and drank half a gallon of water. It tasted excellent—it was the most delicious I had tasted—until I got up and looked at the water again and felt for the little rock. It came up here and there, and I started down on it and came across it on a level.
